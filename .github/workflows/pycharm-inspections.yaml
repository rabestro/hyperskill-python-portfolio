      # Run the PyCharm inspector.
      # This is the core step. It executes the `inspect.sh` script with the necessary arguments.
      # - The first argument is the project directory (`.`).
      # - The second is the path to your inspection profile.
      # - The third is the output directory for the report (`./inspection-results`).
      # - `-f xml` specifies the output format.
      # - `|| true` ensures the workflow continues even if inspections find errors,
      #   so we can always upload the report.
